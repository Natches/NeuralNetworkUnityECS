# Neural Network Unity ECS
## Purpose:
This is the implementation of a genetic Neural network using the new Unity ECS, because the physic is not available in Pure Unity ECS, I have recoded my physic system using Unity ECS too. I did everything in 2 weeks as well as learning Unity ECS. This is the result of the AI project made at Isart Digital Paris this year. I've a MonoBehavior version aswell.
